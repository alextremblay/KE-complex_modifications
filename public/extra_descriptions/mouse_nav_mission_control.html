<h4>Mouse Navigation Mission Controle</h4>

<p>Use ctrl+Mouse fwd/back to Navigate Space left/right, cmd+mouse fwd => Mission Control</p>

<h5>Motivation</h5>

<p>
    Occasionally it could be more convenient to rapidly switch
    between two apps with a simple click of the mouse button.
    This also allows such convenience as selection with the mouse while
    using common keyboard shortcuts (e.g. cut/copy/paste)

    (creator's side note: This was also spurred by a sense of
    repetitive use issues of using the Command+Tab key combination
    frequently)
</p>

<h5>How to use</h5>

<p>
    Enable these rules in Karabiner-Elements under tab 'Complex modifications'.
    In MacOS Settings, under Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control,
    set "Mission Control" to Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+P, 
    set "Move left a space" to Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+U,
    and set "Move right a space" to Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+I.
</p>

<p>
    This ruleset makes it so that your mouse fwd and back buttons continue to work as normal, but when pressed while Ctrl is held down, 
    they can be used to navigate Mision Control spaces, and when Cmd is held down and mouse fwd button is pressed, it triggers mission control.
